## Introduction

Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Available Data
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

### Table 1: runners
The runners table shows the registration_date for each new runner

| runner_id | registration_date |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 2021-01-01        |
| 2         | 2021-01-03        |
| 3         | 2021-01-08        |
| 4         | 2021-01-15        |

### Table 2: customer_orders

Customer pizza orders are captured in the customer_orders table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

The pizza_id relates to the type of pizza which was ordered whilst the exclusions are the ingredient_id values which should be removed from the pizza and the extras are the ingredient_id values which need to be added to the pizza.

Note that customers can order multiple pizzas in a single order with varying exclusions and extras values even if the pizza is the same type!

The exclusions and extras columns will need to be cleaned up before using them in your queries.
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 18:05:02 |

### Table 3: runner_orders
After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The pickup_time is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The distance and duration fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

There are some known data issues with this table so be careful when using this in your queries - make sure to check the data types for each column in the schema SQL!

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time       | distance | duration   | cancellation           |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|------------|------------------------|

  COUNT(runner_id) AS runner_signup
FROM runners
GROUP BY DATEPART(WEEK, registration_date);

```
#### Answer
| registration_week | runner_signup |
|----------|----------|

| 2        | 2        |
| 3        | 1        |

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
SELECT 
    r.runner_id,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time)) AS avg_time
FROM 
    customer_orders c 
JOIN 
    runner_orders r 
ON 
    c.order_id = r.order_id AND r.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY 
    r.runner_id;
d

```
#### Answer
| runner_id | avg_time |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 15       |
| 2         | 24       |
| 3         | 10       |

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id,
        COUNT(pizza_id) AS no_of_pizzas,
        AVG(DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time)) AS avg_time
    FROM 
        customer_orders c 
    JOIN 
        runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id AND r.cancellation = ''
    GROUP BY 
        c.order_id
)
SELECT 
    no_of_pizzas,
    AVG(avg_time) AS avg_prep_time
FROM 
    cte 
GROUP BY 
    no_of_pizzas;


```
#### Answer
| no_of_pizzas | avg_prep_time |
|--------------|---------------|
| 1            | 12            |
| 2            | 18            |

    AVG(CAST(distance AS FLOAT)) AS avg_distance
FROM 
    customer_orders c 
JOIN 
    runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id AND r.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id;
```
#### Answer

SELECT 
    MAX(CAST(duration AS FLOAT)) - MIN(CAST(duration AS FLOAT)) AS time_diff
FROM 
    customer_orders c 
JOIN 
    runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id AND r.cancellation = '';

```
#### Answer
 |avg_distance |
|:-------------|
|30|

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
SELECT 
    r.runner_id,
    c.order_id,
    c.customer_id,
    COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS pizzas,
    SUM(CAST(distance AS FLOAT)) * 60 / SUM(CAST(duration AS FLOAT)) AS avg_speed
FROM 
    customer_orders c 
JOIN 
    runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id AND r.cancellation = '' 
GROUP BY 
    r.runner_id, c.customer_id, c.order_id;

```
#### Answer
| runner_id | order_id | customer_id | pizzas | avg_speed       |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1         | 1        | 101         | 1      | 37.5            |
| 1         | 2        | 101         | 1      | 44.44           |
| 1         | 3        | 102         | 2      | 40.2            |

| 3         | 5        | 104         | 1      | 40              |

1. Runner 1 has varying average speeds across different deliveries, ranging from 37.5 to 60.
2. Runner 2 shows a wide range of average speeds, from 35.1 to 93.6, indicating significant variability in delivery performance.
3. Runner 3 has a single recorded delivery with an average speed of 40.
4. Runner 2 has a high average speed (93.6) for an order with one pizza (order_id 8).

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation <> '' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS success,
    COUNT(cancellation) AS total_orders,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation <> '' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(cancellation) * 100 AS success_percentage
FROM 
    runner_orders
GROUP BY 
    runner_id;

```
#### Answer
| Runner ID | Success Count | Total Orders | Success Percentage |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1         | 4             | 4            | 100%                |
| 2         | 3             | 4            | 75%                 |
