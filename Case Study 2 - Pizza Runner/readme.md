    COUNT(cancellation) AS total_orders,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation <> '' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(cancellation) * 100 AS success_percentage
FROM 
    runner_orders
GROUP BY 
    runner_id;

```
#### Answer
| Runner ID | Success Count | Total Orders | Success Percentage |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
